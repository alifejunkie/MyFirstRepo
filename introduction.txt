Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! My name is Bethel Tesfaye, and I’m from Ethiopia. I’m a passionate content creator with a growing interest in media, storytelling, and sharing perspectives that reflect my culture and background. Whether it’s through video, writing, or conversation, I enjoy exploring thought-provoking topics and connecting with people through honest and engaging content.

Currently, I’m building my voice through projects like my YouTube show Wordsalad with Bethel, where I react to Western news from a non-Western perspective. I’m also working on Ticketgojo, a ticketing platform designed to serve the diverse events scene across Africa. I believe in creativity with purpose—and in telling stories that matter.
